<h3> Object detection has been viewed as one of the areas that can have a massive impact ahead in technology and business. Several technologies such as Self Driving Cars and Drones are currently this using technique as the core of their functionality. </h3>

*   Here, I have tried to perform object detection using cvlib which is a Computer Vision library in Python. <br>
* The library uses bounding boxes to detect objects.I tried to count the number of objects in the image. <br>
* To use this library, we have to have Tensorflow and and OpenCV pre-installed.To install cvlib, run _pip install cvlib_. <br>
* The output image is:
